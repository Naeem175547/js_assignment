The ternary operator in JavaScript is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It allows you to write a concise expression that
 evaluates to one of two values based on a condition. The syntax for the ternary operator is as follows:

javascript code
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
Here, condition is the expression that is evaluated. If it's true, the expression_if_true is returned; otherwise, expression_if_false is
 returned.


javascript code
// Function to check if a number is even or odd using the ternary operator
function checkEvenOrOdd(number) {
    // Ternary operator to check if the number is even or odd
    let result = number % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";
    
    
    console.log(`${number} is ${result}.`);
}

checkEvenOrOdd(5);  
checkEvenOrOdd(10);
